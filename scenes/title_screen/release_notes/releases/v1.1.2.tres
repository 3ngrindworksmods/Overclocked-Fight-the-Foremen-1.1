notes = "[TITLE]Items
Added Fire Hydrant (3-Star)
Added Straw Hat (3- Star)
Added Accessory Trunk (4-Star)
Rebalanced some item pools
Gumball Machine now takes 4 charges
Increased Gumball Machine's Super Candy chance to 20%
For Modders: Centralized the item pools so modifying items and item pools at runtime is much easier
[TITLE]Bosses
Slightly decreased the speed of the Golf Balls in the Fairway Fiend boss fight on later floors
The realtime boss fight intro cutscenes are now skippable
[TITLE]Tweaks
It is no longer possible to reroll a specific Cog Task into another specific Cog Task
Added a keybind for ending your turn
[TITLE]Bugfixes
Fixed a bug where the status effects panel wouldn't expand when a Cog has over 8 status effects
Fixed a bug where skyboxes would stick around if you exited a floor using White-Out
Fixed a bug where using White-Out on the Ground Floor would allow level 3 Cogs to spawn on the repeated floor
Fixed some issues where lava pits wouldn't teleport you out if you were invincible
Potentially fixed a rare bug where the D.A. Office Elevator camera would take over the screen when spawned in
Also, made the \"I'm Stuck\" button refocus the Player camera as a failsafe for any additional camera shenanigans
Definitely and for real this time fixed the issue where the Paint Silo elevator wouldn't spawn in the right place
Major text fixes"
